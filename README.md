## Hyperledger Fabric in a nutshell: 
An enterprize grade distributed ledger based on Blockchain technologies that uses Smart Contracts to enforce trust between parties. Source: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EpPrSJtqZU&feature=youtu.be)

## Let's take a look at a simple Hyperledger Fabric business network

....your first network (BYFN) scenario provisions a sample Hyperledger Fabric network 
consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer nodes, and a "solo" ordering service. 

A blockchain network is comprised primarily of 

a set of peer nodes (or, simply, peers). 

Peers are a fundamental element of the network because they host ledgers and smart contracts. 

Recall that a ledger immutably records all the transactions generated by smart contracts (or chaincode). 

Smart contracts and ledgers are used to encapsulate the shared processes and shared information in a network, respectively. 

These aspects of a peer make them a good starting point to understand a Hyperledger Fabric network.

hyperledger/fabric-javaenv    Go is the default chaincode language, however there is also support for Node.js and Java      
                              chaincode. 1.3.0
hyperledger/fabric-ca         https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#welcome-to-hyperledger-fabric-ca-certificate-authority   

Every single operation in the Hyperledger Fabric must be signed by an X.509 certificate. The Fabric-ca certificate authority is used for generating X.509 certificates.
